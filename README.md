QMEM CRM was developed as a practical and educational project to demonstrate the core principles of web development using PHP and MySQL. While it's simple by design, it provides a solid foundation for building more complex CRM systems in the future.

If you're a developer or student looking to explore PHP-based applications, feel free to clone, modify, and expand this project. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

Thank you for checking out QMEM CRM! ⭐
